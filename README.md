# w3134_data_structures
programming assignments for W3134 Data Structures (22F) at Columbia University

theoretical assignments are omitted for the sake of tidiness of my repo. otherwise this repo will be filled with .docx, .pdf. .drawio, etc.

If you need me to take down this repo, reach me at xq2224 at columbia dot edu. I'll be happy to help!

Several things to note:
1. The test shell script for extra_credit1 is HUGE. That's why GitHub tag this repo as shell. But the course is taught in Java.
2. Please read the README for each project, if there is any.
